Supply department is what keeps the station moving, thanks to constant deliveries from NAS Trurl and Lavaland. It can be divided into two parts:

Miners, who are constantly risking their life on a hellish planet, to supply highly desired ore to your station.
Cargo bay and office, responsible for supplying goods, distributing mail and handling crate shipments.
Working in cargo is rather simple, which makes it a perfect starter department. This guide is meant to explain the second part, cargo and how to handle it.
